# Grid Optimal Scheduling

The grid optimal scheduling problem resolution (a part of the TU Delft DIIES course)

**This repository is a placeholder for a project I will be publishing in the next weeks, exciting times!**

## Purpose

Help the grid operator of Delftini to investigate the effect of different parameters (unit types, limits and other settings) on the optimal schedule.

Optimal scheduling helps grid operators determine how much each unit in their system should produce. At the same time, the operator can enforce a different operation by giving units a different cost. But, this information can also help with investment decisions. If you know how the system behaves and what is missing, you know better what to invest in.
